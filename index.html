    <div class="my-text">You're welcome! Yes, that's correct. The font rendering can vary between different platforms and rendering contexts, which can result in slight differences in the appearance of text. In general, using CSS to render text tends to produce crisper and more consistent results across different browsers and devices, while canvas rendering can be more variable depending on the rendering context and anti-aliasing settings.</div>
